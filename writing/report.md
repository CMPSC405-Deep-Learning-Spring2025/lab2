# Lab 2 Report

## Neural Network 

TODO: Provide an overview of your prediction task and discuss how your network was extended.

## Feedback

### Initial Feedback

TODO: Describe at least two specific suggestions you have incorporated into your extended neural network.

### Mid-Assignment Presentation

TODO: Discuss how feedback from peers and the instructor was incorporated.

## Experiments

TODO: Describe your experimental set up and the choices you made to automate your experiments. 

### Experiment 1: Activation Functions
- TODO: Describe at least three activation functions you tested.
- TODO: Discuss their impact on model performance.
- TODO: Include visualizations (e.g., loss curves, scatter plots, etc).
- TODO: Relate the findings to the discussion of activation functions in Chapter 4.

### Experiment 2: Hyperparameter Tuning
- TODO: Describe at least three hyperparameters used in experiments.
- TODO: Discuss their impact on model performance.
- TODO: Include visualizations (e.g., loss curves, scatter plots, etc).
- TODO: Connect observations to optimization techniques discussed in Chapter 3.

### Experiment 3: Loss Functions
- TODO: Describe at least two loss functions used in experiments.
- TODO: Discuss their impact on model performance.
- TODO: Include visualizations (e.g., loss curves, scatter plots, etc.).
- TODO: Consider how loss functions are introduced and utilized in Chapters 3 and 4.

### Experiment 5: Using GitHub Copilot

TODO: Document at least three different types of prompts (i.e., debugging, explaining, code completion) that were used iteratively. Use the format below to discuss prompt modifications and reflect on their effectiveness and limitations.
- **Prompt Type**: Debugging/Explaining/Code Completion
- **Prompt Description**: Detailed description of the prompt used.
- **Copilot Suggestion**: The suggestion provided by Copilot.
- **Effectiveness**: How effective the suggestion was and any modifications made.
